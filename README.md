## Volume of Distribution

Volume Distribution is a pharmacokinetical parameter for drugs. With the help of the parameter, one can have a clear insight to various properties of drug like lipophilicity, pH etc. The program will generate the value of steady state volume distribution, areal volume distribution, eliminnation constant and half-life of elimination. Additionally, one datasheet is made with quite a few known drugs and their volume distribution values, so that one can compare. It also generates two graphs. One is Concentration Vs Time curve, another one is logConcentration Vs Time curve.
