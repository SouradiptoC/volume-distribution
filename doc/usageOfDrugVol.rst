Usage of Volume Distribution
****************************

General Usage
=============
The Volume Distribution values can be used to have an insight for certain things like:

:pH: pH values of drugs depends on many factors. We can predict the pH nature of drug, in a gross level, by looking at the values of volume distribution.

   * :High: A higher pH value i.e. basic nature is indicated by a higher value of Volume Distribution.
   * :Low: A lower pH value i.e. acidic nature is indicated by a lower value of Volume Distribution.

:Lipophilicity: The lipophilicity or lipophobicity of a drug can be grossly predicted by having a look at values of volume distribution.

    * :Lipophilic: A higher value of volume distribution indicates lipophilicity of the drug.
    * :Lipophobic: A lower value of volume distribution indicates lipophobicity of the drug.

How To Use This program
=======================

#. :Curve: For a certain element, if plasma concentraion in various times can be provided, the from the Conc vs time curve, one can find the best fit compartmental model from the drug.
#. :Value: Volume distribution value can be compared with some known drugs in order to have a greater insight.
